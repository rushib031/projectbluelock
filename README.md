Project Enhancements:
We have created several new enhancements that Carmen currently does not offer. 
    1. From their current courses, users are able to select which courses they wish to see their "To Do List" for. 
    2. In our HTML page, users are able to see ALL upcoming and completed assignments sorted by due date and class. 
    3. Users can view the full list of TAs and Graders for each class. 


Purpose of Enhancements:
Currently, the web version of Carmen only allows users to see the top 7 - 8 items on their To-do list. On top of that, it displays assignments from random classes and it also displays announcements on top of that as well. Our new enhancements allow users to see ALL assignments for whichever class they would like and can show more than one class. This helps users visualize their assignments in a cleaner, more efficient way. In addition, users can focus on completing all assignments (in order of due date or priority) for each course before moving to the next. Users also have the option to view the class's TAs and/or graders and reach out to others if they are struggling/need help. If there are no TAs or graders for a course it will defer users to speak with their professor for additional help.
